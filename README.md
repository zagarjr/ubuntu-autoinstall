# Autoinstall with Netboot with Advanced Storage Configuration

This project implements an automated installation process using Ubuntu's autoinstall feature combined with netboot capabilities. It includes an advanced storage configuration designed to meet specific requirements, such as those outlined in DISA STIG for Ubuntu desktop environments.

## Overview

The installation process utilizes a pre-install shell script to customize the autoinstall.yaml configuration file. This allows for dynamic generation of storage layouts, including LVM (Logical Volume Management) for flexibility and efficient disk space utilization.

## Files Included

### 1. autoinstall.yaml Template

The `autoinstall.yaml` template serves as the base configuration for Ubuntu installation. It includes sections for partitioning, LVM setup, and filesystem configurations tailored to ensure compliance with DISA STIG requirements.

### 2. Pre-Install Shell Script (pre-install.sh)

The `pre-install.sh` script is executed before installation begins. It performs tasks such as:
- Determining the appropriate disk for installation (e.g., smallest disk).
- Generating the storage configuration dynamically based on specified requirements.
- Merging the generated storage section into the `autoinstall.yaml` template.
- Optionally, fetching the `autoinstall.yaml` template from an external source for modularity and easier updates.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Environment:**
   - Set up a PXE boot server or use existing infrastructure for netboot installations.
   - Ensure the `autoinstall.yaml` template and `pre-install.sh` script are accessible from the network or embedded within the netboot environment.

2. **Customize Configuration:**
   - Modify the `autoinstall.yaml` template to reflect specific partitioning, LVM, and filesystem requirements as per project needs.
   - Adjust the `pre-install.sh` script if additional customization or logic is required for your environment.

3. **Initiate Installation:**
   - Boot the target machine using the netboot image configured to initiate autoinstall.
   - The installation process will automatically execute the `pre-install.sh` script to generate the final `autoinstall.yaml` configuration.
   - Follow on-screen prompts or automated steps to complete the Ubuntu installation with the advanced storage configuration.

## Notes

- This setup assumes familiarity with Ubuntu installation, LVM, and basic shell scripting.
- Verify compatibility and adjust configurations based on specific hardware and project requirements.
- Monitor installation logs and outputs for troubleshooting and validation during deployment.
